# Practical-Transactional-Anomaly-Detector
In finance Such as Banking , Ecommerce some users perform illegal transactions in the database and those transactions leave records in database. How ever this database is mostly composed of non criminal transactions from the people who comply with the rules of the system they are part of.

**Good news:** Our database has all the records for idenitfy the crime.No need for data gathering.

**Bad news:** Fraudlent transactions of the data is buried in millions of records and you might not recognise fradualnt transaction in the records.

**Challenges:**

Need for automation mainly because the sheer size of the records make the manual validation of the data to identify the anomaly is impossible to check all records.

If the problem is that the human expersts dont have the time to go through the dataset can we try to automate their decision process?
